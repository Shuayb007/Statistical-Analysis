Stratified Sampling is a random sampling method that ensures each subgroups (strata) of a given population are adequately represented within the whole sample population. 


Descriptive statistics seeks to answer the question, what relationship exists between variables in the sample. 
Inferential Statistics is such that given a relationship exist between variables in the sample, how much evidence exist for a relationship in the population. Is there a significant evidence in the sample data for a relationship to exist in the population or the relationship might just be due to chance or luck?
